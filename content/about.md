My name is Linn Sofie, I am a neuroscientist and PhD candidate affiliated with the Oslo University Hospital/University of Oslo and the Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research ([NORMENT](https://www.med.uio.no/norment/english/)).

In my PhD project I am investigating the role of low-grade inflammation in cognitive impairment -- a common symptom in severe mental illnesses including schizophrenia and bipolar spectrum disorders. The project involves analysis of inflammatory and immune-related markers both at the periphery (blood) and centrally (brain). Using large samples (\>1000 participants), multiple modes of measurement and advanced statistical modelling, we hope to further elucidate immune-brain interactions in severe mental illness. Immune-brain interactions and its relationship to cognitive functioning is not only relevant in psychiatry, but also other conditions, including neurodevelopmental-, neurodegenerative- and autoimmune diseases.

I am currently learning advanced statistical methods, Open Science and the creation of both beautiful and informative plots using R. I am a former SPSS user. Send help.

Other than my research interests, I love spending my time reading, exercising, drawing/painting, sewing/embroidering, and cuddling with my italian greyhound named Nala. Check out her Instagram [@Nalatheitalian](https://https://www.instagram.com/nalatheitalian/).
